You can check if API is online and working by clicking on API inline Documentation. If you arrive on a page named : **GLPI REST API: Documentation** you're all good âœ”

Then go back to **Setup** > **General** > **API**

If you want to provide some security, you can set an IP range restriction but be aware that your mobile device where the application will be installed has to be in this range. Leave it empty if you do not want to put some restrictions.
